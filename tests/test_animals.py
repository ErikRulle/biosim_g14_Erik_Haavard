"""
Test set for superclass Animals, and subclasses Herbivores and Carnivores.

Test set for Animal class along with the subclasses Herbivores and Carnivores.

This set of tests checks the interface of the BioSim class to be provided by
the simulation module of the biosim package.

Notes:
     - The classes should pass all tests in this set.
     - The tests check only that the class interface can be used, not that
       the class functions correctly. You need to write your own tests for that.
     - You should only run these tests on your code *after* you have implemented
       both animal and all landscape classes.
